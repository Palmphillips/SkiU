# SkiU
Carpool Website for CU Students

Members - John, Hassan, Jack, Duaa, Sousheeel 


Description - 





Vision Statement - SkiU is a website built to help CU students carpool to ski resorts in order to make the process of finding a ride easier for freshman.


Motivation - Our motivation comes from our own frustrations trying to find rides to the mountains with no luck. This product will help new Colorado residents avoid this problem.


Risks - Some of the risks associated with development might be:
- Lack of experience
- Inability to get authetication with CU identikey. Hindering access to CU students
- Storing user information/ Server to host website
- Matching algorithm and how complicated we want it to be.

Risk Mitigation Plan -
- Putting in more time to offset lack of experience
- Talk to identikey people early. Use alternatives, such as authenticating by email domain. 
- Consult with professor about user information and hosting
- Start simple with matching algorithm and build up

Version Control - We already set up our GitHub repository and had everyone add a test push. We plan on adding the TA, grader, and professor as soon as possible. 
 

Development Method - Our team will be using Agile. - Sousheel here -



Collaboration Tool - Our team will be using slack, groupme, and an agile site to coordinate and communicate. We will make announcements in slack with any updates we make. We also meet weekly on Thursday to talk about progression.


Proposed Architeture - For the front end we plan to use HTML, Javascript, and CSS. For the back end we will be using Python and SQL.
The front end languages will handle user input, while Python will use the input to match people and display driver availability.
